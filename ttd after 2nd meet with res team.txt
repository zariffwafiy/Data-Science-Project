things to consider:
* water content might be affected by the duration of honey in pot
* some pot are not authentic / original (plastic / polymer), might affect water content

future work:
classify by location
data augmentation to improve accuracy 
classify purity if have adultered samples 
impute based on different central statistics, (set to 30, 31, 32)
correlation between pF -> TPC, TFC
correlation between water content -> ABTS, FRAP & TPC, TFC
